This repository hosts the infrastructure project for Scopely Challenge. We need to tun this project first to get all the infrastructure running.

This project contains:

- Database for Players (Postgresql)
- Database for Battles (Postgresql)
- Message broker for queues (RabbitMQ)

To run the infrastructure:

docker-compose up -d
